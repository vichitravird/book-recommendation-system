# ML Based Book Recommender System

This project is a collaborative filtering-based book recommender system built using machine learning techniques. The recommender system analyzes user preferences and book ratings to provide personalized recommendations.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend books based on user behavior and preferences.
  
- **Dataset:** Built using a dataset of book ratings and user interactions, allowing for accurate recommendation predictions.
  
- **Python Implementation:** Implemented in Python using popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.
  
## How it Works

The recommender system employs collaborative filtering algorithms to predict book ratings for users. By leveraging user-item interactions, it identifies patterns and similarities to suggest books that users are likely to enjoy based on their historical preferences.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the dataset by cleaning and structuring book ratings and user information.
2. **Model Training:** Train the collaborative filtering model using the processed dataset.
3. **Recommendations:** Generate personalized book recommendations for users based on their preferences.

## Getting Started
